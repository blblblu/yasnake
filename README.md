# yasnake

Simple Snake clone using SFML.

This is a project I did as a part of my final Abitur presentation exam ("Besondere Lernleistung"). Therefore, be advised that the code quality isn't very good, and the later additions are mostly to keep it buildable.

This project uses the [cmake-sfml-project](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project) template, which is licensed under the MIT license.
